Slime notes [LVL 3]

From my recent adventures into what I call the “Slime Garden” I’ve discovered many different slimes as well as what seems to be a source. The source seems to be a sort of flower that oozes out the slime. I’ve seen four types of slimes in the slime garden. These are the green, blue, grey, and yellow slimes. The former three are much easier to defeat than the yellow slimes. There also is a correlation between color and stat bonuses for each slime. Green slimes for vitality, blue slimes for…. Blue, grey for defense and yellow for attack.

Pest Exterminator [LVL 1]

There has been an increase in pests (Moss gnomes, wood bats, and carpenter ants) in the area. Exterminate them!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defensive Decrease [LVL 6]

Due to reasons speculated, a group of insane individuals have been spotted wandering the forest, and it is not safe to travel the roads anymore. Reports say that there are 3 different types of people in the group: crazed men, hunters, and magicians. Find and kill them.

P.S. rumor has it that these people were previously seen entering the fallen grove, home to the “deadwood” forest.

-5 crazed men
-3 crazed hunters
-3 crazed magicians


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Golem Gauntlet [LVL 14]

I’ve taken an interest in the local collection of golems! The 4 main types are wood, mud, quartz, and alloy! Simply bring me the materials for my research and I shall give you the firsthand account of a new strengthening item! Oh, but be careful, the golems have a very high defense!

-10 (mud and wood golem drop)
-8 quartz
-6 alloy

Reward: Golem Gauntlet (gives bonus to def. and str.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deadly Adventure [LVL 13?]

Many people have been disappearing in the fallen grove, or deadwood forest. There are a multitude of different enemies there, and most are decaying. Not much is known about the area, but rumors say that there is a shrieking coming from the middle of the forest at midnight. The only way to get there is by boat, so I’ll give you a special ticket that will let you ride for free. Use it how you like.
